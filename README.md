# Neural Network Tutorial

This is a Python tutorial that shows you how to build a neural network from scratch using numpy and scipy. You will learn the main concepts and steps involved in creating and training a neural network, such as vectors, weights, biases, activation functions, error functions, backpropagation, and more.

## Installation
To run this tutorial, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries:

numpy: A library for scientific computing and linear algebra
scipy: A library for scientific and technical computing, including the expit function for the sigmoid activation function
You can install these libraries using pip:

`pip install numpy scipy`

Alternatively, you can use a virtual environment such as Anaconda or virtualenv to manage your dependencies.

## Usage
To run the tutorial, simply open the neural_network.py file in your preferred editor or IDE and follow the comments and instructions. You can also run the file from the command line:

`python neural_network.py`

The file contains the code for creating a neural network class, initializing the weight matrices, running the network with an input vector, and training the network with a target vector. You can modify the parameters and the data to experiment with different configurations and results.
